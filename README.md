Hello everyone! My name is Calvin and I currently live in Kansas. I am trying to start a new career with front-end web development and hopefully in the future, become a full-stack
web developer. Currently I am teaching myself from codeCademy and other online sources. Although this is a great way to learn, I am hoping that I will be able to learn from all the interesting people
on githb, codeCademy, and stack overflow. 
When I am not learning I am a mechanic by trade. After a day of turning a wrench I enjoy a session at the gym. 
Please feel free to talk to me! I would appreiate the advice and any help!

Thank you!!
